# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Plan the Features:

Define the key features such as displaying live cryptocurrency prices, market caps, and volume.
Choose a Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js.
Backend: Node.js, Express.js.
Database: MongoDB or other databases for storing user data if needed.
APIs: Use cryptocurrency APIs (e.g., CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap) for fetching real-time data.
Setup the Development Environment:

Install Node.js and npm.
Create a new React project using create-react-app.
Set up a backend using Express.js.
Frontend Development:

Design the user interface using HTML and CSS.
Implement components in React to display data.
Use Axios or Fetch API to call the cryptocurrency APIs and display data on the frontend.
Backend Development:

Set up Express.js server.
Create routes to handle API requests.
Implement logic to fetch data from cryptocurrency APIs and send it to the frontend.
Integrate APIs:

Sign up for a cryptocurrency data API.
Fetch data using the API key and integrate it into the backend.
Ensure data is updated at regular intervals using cron jobs or similar scheduling techniques.
Testing:

Test the application to ensure data is displayed correctly.
Fix any bugs or issues that arise.
Deployment:

Deploy the frontend on platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
Deploy the backend on platforms like Heroku or DigitalOcean.
Ensure the application is live and accessible.
Maintenance:

Regularly update the application for any API changes.
Monitor the application's performance and scalability.
This is a high-level overview, and each step can be expanded with more detailed tasks as required.
